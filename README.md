# HTTP Pets

A delightful interactive playground for learning HTTP methods. Each HTTP method has its own "pet" character that responds differently based on the type of request you make.

## Features

- Visual representation of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Interactive pets that respond to different request types
- Educational tool for understanding HTTP methods
- Fun animations and feedback

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## HTTP Methods

- **GET**: Retrieves information, pet looks happy
- **POST**: Creates new resources, pet gets excited
- **PUT**: Updates entire resource, pet transforms
- **PATCH**: Partial updates, pet changes slightly
- **DELETE**: Removes resources, pet disappears temporarily
